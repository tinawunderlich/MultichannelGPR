# CONTRIBUTING

If you are interested in contributing to MultichannelGPR, there are several possibilities:

## Bug reports
Bug reports are very helpful in improving the program and are highly appreciated.
When making bug reports in issues, please include:
- a description of your problem: What did you expect to happen and what happened actually?
- a description of the processing steps that you did before.
- a description of your data (which equipment was used, was it measured with GNSS/total station/hand marker/...?)
- which operating system you use.

## Adding new features
If you have an idea for a new feature, please raise an issue and describe your idea. We can then discuss if/how this can be included and who is going to do this.
